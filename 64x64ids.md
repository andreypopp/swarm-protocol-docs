## Base64x64 integers, timestamps and ids

The Swarm protocol uses lots of ids, timestamps and pre-defined constants.
The unifying format for all of those is a 64 bit integer.
Using 32-bit ints is not nearly enough, either for timestamps or entity ids.
Free-form strings are too frivolous, especially Unicode (UTF-8, UTF-16, special symbols, etc etc).
Hence, `in64_t` (`long` in Java).
Unfortunately, some langs (JavaScript) don't have 64-bit integers and JavaScript numbers are [dangerous to use][snowflake] in this context.
Also, binary numbers are a bit too hardcore; the serialized format better be human-readable.
Hence, Swarm needed a string-based representation for 64-bit ints, preferably Base64-based (6 bits per char, can use in URL paths).

Importantly, Swarm does lots of causality-and-order comparisons for ids and timestamps.
So, the natural alphanumeric ordering of strings must be the same as the original numeric order.
That bans any common variety of Base64 from being used, as Base64 symbols do not go in their ASCII order.
Also, full 64 bits is a bit too much sometimes, so a variable-length encoding is a must (see Google's [varints][varint]).

Hence, Swarm employs this Base64x64 encoding:
* 64-bit numbers are represented as 1 to 10 Base64 chars (10*6=60, 4 bits are reserved)
* Base64 variety is `0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ_abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz~` (non-standard)
* *tailing* zeroes are skipped (a bit counter-intuitive, as the normal Arabic notation skips *leading* zeroes)

This way, the numeric order of int64_t matches the alphanumeric order of our Base64.

That way, Swarm can use uniform 64x64 numbers for:
* variable-precision timestamps,
* replica ids and
* predefined constants.

Variable-precision timestamps have the `MMDHMSmmss` format.
10 Base64 chars encode months-since-epoch, days, hours, minutes, seconds, milliseconds and an additional sequence number.
It is OK to use e.g. `1CQAneDm` (7 chars) or `1CQAneD` (5 chars, `MMDHM`, no seconds).

Replica ids are hierarchical, so tailing zeroes and variable lengths play here too.

A bit counter-intuitively, all predefined constants (like operation names) are *very* big numbers.
For example, "on" decodes to 932808072819113984. Which is not bad, actually.

The variable-length trick provides significant savings when Base64x64 numbers are concatenated.
For example, a full-form specifier has 4 logical timestamps, thus 4*2=8 of 64-bit longs, plus separators.
Still, it can be as short as `/Swarm#testdb!1CQC2u3u+X.on+X`

So, Base64x64 is like varint, but for text-based formats and it is mostly used for timestamps and identifiers.
