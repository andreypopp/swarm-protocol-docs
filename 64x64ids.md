## 64x64 ids

The Swarm protocol uses lots of ids, timestamps and pre-defined constants.
A unifying format for all of those is a 64 bit integer.
Using 32-bit ints is not enough for timestamps or entity ids, and strings are too frivolous.
Hence, `uin64_t`.
Unfortunately, some langs (JavaScript) don't have 64-bit ints and JavaScript numbers are generally dangerous to use.
Hence, needs a string form for 64-bit numbers.
Swarm does lots of causality-and-order comparisons for ids and timestamps.
So, the natural alphanumeric ordering of strings must be the same as the original numeric order.
That bans any common variety of Base64 from being used, as Base64 symbols do not go in their ASCII order.
Also, 64 bits is a bit too gorgeous sometimes, so a variable-length encoding is a must (see Google's [varints][varint]).

Hence, the 64x64 encoding:
* 64-bit numbers are represented as 1 to 10 Base64 chars (10*6=60, 4 bits are reserved)
* Base64 variety is `0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ_abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz~` (non-standard)
* *tailing* zeroes are skipped (a bit counter-intuitive, as normal Arabic notation skips *leading* zeroes)

This way, the numeric order matches the alphanumeric order of Base64.

That way, Swarm can use uniform 64x64 numbers for:
* variable-precision timestamps,
* replica ids and
* predefined constants.

Variable-precision timestamps have the `MMDHMSmmss` format.
10 Base64 chars encode Thmonths-since-epoch, days, hours, minutes, seconds, milliseconds, sequence number.
It is OK to use e.g. `1CQAneDm` (7 chars) or `1CQAneD` (5 chars, `MMDHM`, no seconds).

Replica ids are hierarchical, so tailing zeroes and variable lengths play here too.

A bit counter-intuitively, all predefined constants (like operation names) are *very* big numbers.
For example, "on" decodes to 932808072819113984. Which is not bad, actually.
